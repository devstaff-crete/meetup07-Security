# meetup07-Security

On February 11, 2016, DevStaff-Crete had a talk on Developing (Web Apps) with Security in mind.
In this repository you can find the files assocated with the presentation. More specifically,
there are the slides and the Keynote file if you want to review / present them. The OWASP Top10
slides will also be added to the OWASP blog along with other slides so future presenters have a
large selection of slides to choose from.
